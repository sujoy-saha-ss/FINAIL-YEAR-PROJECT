Plant Disease Detectionüåø Project OverviewThis project is an application for detecting various diseases in plants based on images. It utilizes a pre-trained deep learning model to classify the plant's health status, aiming to assist farmers and gardeners in early diagnosis.‚ú® FeaturesImage-based Diagnosis: Upload a plant leaf image for classification.Deep Learning Model: Uses a high-accuracy classification model (stored in model.h5).Web Application Interface: User-friendly interface built with Python and Streamlit/Flask (based on app.py).üõ†Ô∏è Setup and InstallationPrerequisitesBefore running the application, ensure you have the following installed:Python 3.xpip (Python package installer)1. Clone the repositoryBashgit clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]
cd Plant-Disease-Detection-main
2. Set up the Virtual EnvironmentIt is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.Bash# Create a virtual environment (if not already created by 'venv' folder)
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
(Note: The venv directory in your screenshot suggests this step might be partially done, but activating it is still necessary.)3. Install DependenciesAll necessary Python packages are listed in requirements.txt.Bashpip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the ApplicationThe main application is located in app.py.Bash# Assuming the application uses Streamlit or Flask and is runnable via 'python app.py'
python app.py
# If it's a Streamlit app, it might be:
# streamlit run app.py
Follow the output in the terminal to find the local URL where the application is running (e.g., http://localhost:8501).üìÅ File StructureFile/FolderDescriptionapp.pyThe main Python script for the web application (e.g., Streamlit or Flask).model.h5The trained deep learning model weights and architecture (in HDF5 format).requirements.txtLists all necessary Python dependencies for the project.setup.shA shell script possibly used for deploying or environment setup.util.pyUtility functions or helper classes used by the main application.Plant Disease Detection.ipynbA Jupyter Notebook likely containing the model training, experimentation, or data analysis.venv/The Python virtual environment directory.ProcfileUsed by platforms like Heroku to specify the process types and startup command.üöÄ Deployment (Optional)This project contains a Procfile and a setup.sh, which are often used for deployment on platforms like Heroku.To deploy, you would typically:Configure your deployment platform.Push your code to a remote repository.The platform will use requirements.txt, Procfile, and possibly setup.sh to build and run the application.ü§ù ContributingFeel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit pull requests.
